        <p>CSS is a fundamental part of web design because it controls how your web pages look.
             Without it, websites would only be able to display text on white backgrounds. 
             Use CSS to take your plain HTML websites to the next level. Whether you're just trying to customize your Squarespace page or contemplating a career switch, 
             learning the fundamentals of CSS from the ground up gives you the ability to do everything from tweaking existing CSS to writing your own.
              Hi, I'm Christina Truong, and I invite you to join me for my course on LinkedIn Learning where I'll cover all the foundations of CSS.
               Starting from how CSS is structured to frequently used CSS styles and the various ways CSS let's you layout a page. 
               By the end of this course you'll have an actual project, an online portfolio and resume page that you have styled in CSS.</p>
