d Delete; cut but remain in normal mode

p Paste after the cursor

Copy/paste commands operate on the specified range. If in visual mode, that range is the
highlighted text. If in normal mode, that range is specified by a series of modifiers to the
commands:
cw Change one word
c4w Change four words
c4l Change four letters
cc Change current line
4x Change four characters after the cursor
4p Paste five times after the cursor.
Modifiers work similarly for cut, delete, yank and paste.
